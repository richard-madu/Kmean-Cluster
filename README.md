## Overview

This project explores the captivating world of flowers through the lens of K-means clustering, a powerful unsupervised machine learning algorithm. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to uncover natural groupings within a dataset of flowers and gain deeper insights into their botanical relationships.

## Key Features

- **K-means Clustering:** Uncover inherent structures within the flower dataset by grouping flowers based on shared features.
  
- **Elbow Method:** Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, a powerful technique for finding that sweet spot where the reduction in variance sharply slows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-clustering.git
   cd flower-clustering
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Explore the project files and Jupyter notebooks to delve into the code, visualizations, and insights gained from the flower clustering process. Run the notebooks for an interactive exploration.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, clustering, and analysis.
- `data/`: Dataset of flowers.
